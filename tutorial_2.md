# Tutorial 2: Plotting Options

In this tutorial, you will learn about the plotting options of beamModelTester.  If you have not completed [Tutorial 1](/tutorial_1.md) you should do so now.


## Select the variables
Now that we have comparable data, it's time to learn how to select the variables for the plots you wish to generate.  From the Main Menu select "plotting options."

![Plotting Options menu](/images/interactive_snips/gicm_5_plot_menu.PNG)

From there, click on "select variables to plot."  This will bring up a menu that allows you to select which channels to plot.  By default, the linear (xx, yy) and cross (xy) plots are generated.  From this menu you can select linear channels or Stokes parameters individually, by group, or all at once.  There are also options for plotting linegraphs overlaid or separate from one another.  These are not used in this tutorial

Click on the option to toggle plotting of the Stokes Parameters now, then return to the main menu and "Plot with current options"

*Plotting with Stokes and Linear parameters produces a total of 14 plots, one each for the model data and the observation of each of the 4 Stokes and 3 Linear channels.  Two samples of the output are shown above.*
