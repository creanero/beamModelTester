# Figures of Merit
beamModelTester is designed to compare models (such as the Hamaker model) with observations to allow for an assessment of the quality of the model.  Therefore, a figure of merit that can be calculated for the relationship between these is needed before a qualitative assessment of multiple models can meaningfully be made.  The two figures of merit used are Root Mean Squared Error and Pearson's Correlation.

## RMSE

## Pearson's Correlation

## Plot vs Frequency

## Plot vs Time

This is the end of this tutorial.  In [Tutorial 7](/tutorial_7.md), we will look at making offsets and changes to the scale of the system.
