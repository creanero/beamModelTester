# Tutorial 6: Figures of Merit
beamModelTester is designed to compare models (such as the Hamaker model) with observations to allow for an assessment of the quality of the model.  Therefore, a figure of merit that can be calculated for the relationship between these is needed before a qualitative assessment of multiple models can meaningfully be made.  The two figures of merit used are Root Mean Squared Error and Pearson's Correlation.

Follow the previous tutorials such that you have the [data](/tutorial_1.md#input) loaded into memory, and create [xx channel](/tutorial_2.md#variables) plots for the model, the scope and the [difference](/tutorial_2.md#differences) with [filtered frequencies](/tutorial_3.md#file), [normalisation](/tutorial_1.md#normalisation) but no [cropping](/tutorial_1.md#cropping).  Add the [target](/tutorial_5.md#target) and [location](/tutorial_5.md#location) information to enable horizontal coordinate plotting. Once you have this done, you are ready to start this tutorial.

## Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
The RMSE is a measure of the average separation between the observed and model values.  This measure is dimension dependent, and should therefore only be used with normalised data.  



## Pearson's Correlation

## Plot vs Frequency

## Plot vs Time

This is the end of this tutorial.  In [Tutorial 7](/tutorial_7.md), we will look at making offsets and changes to the scale of the system.
