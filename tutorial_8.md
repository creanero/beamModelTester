# Visual Options
In this tutorial we will cover plotting options which change the way the data is presented.  These can be useful when generating plots for print, covering options such as plot size, resolution and colourschemes.

Using what you've learned in previous tutorials, select the [data from the station SE607](/tutroial_1.md#acquire), select the [xx channel](/tutorial_2.md#variables) to plot and enable [logarithmic scaling](/tutorial_7.md#log) and pick a suitable directory in which to store the [output files](/tutorial_4.md). 

## Plot Dimensions
This section covers file size and file resolution suitable for putting into a print format
### Plot Size
To change the dimensions of the plot, go to "other options" from the main menu, and then select "Set Image Size" to bring up the image size menu shown below.

![image size menu](/images/interactive_snips/gicm_8_6_size.png)![filled image](/images/interactive_snips/gicm_8_6_1_size_filled.png)

Enter a width of 8 and a height of 3 into the menu and then plot in the usual way.  Note that if you're not using file output, you will be restricted to the size of your screen.  If you use the options shown above you should get an image something like the one shown below. You may need to follow the link to get the correct image size.

### Plot Resolution (DPI)
An important concern for print setup is the resolution of the image to be shown.  This can be selected from the resolution menu. Go to "other options" from the main menu, and then select "Set Image Resolution" to bring up the menu shown below. 

![image size menu](/images/interactive_snips/gicm_8_7_dpi.png)

Enter a resolution of 300dpi to the text box and then plot the image.  Again, you should get something that looks like the image below.

## Colourscheme
When printing, it may be useful to change some of how the plots are displayed and in particular how the background is applied. This can be selected from the colourscheme menu. Go to "other options" from the main menu, and then select "Set Colourschemes" to bring up the menu shown below. 

![image size menu](/images/interactive_snips/gicm_8_8_colour.png)

Select each of the options in turn to generate the images shown below.
