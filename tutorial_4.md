# Tutorial 4

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use beamModelTester to save images and animations to disk instead of displaying them to the screen.  Depending on your implementation, you may be able to save images directly from the matplotlib window that pops up when a graph is plotted, but usually it is not possible to save animated plots in this way.

Follow [the](/tutorial_1.md) [previous](/tutorial_2.md) [tutorials](/tutorial_3.md) such that you have the data loaded into memory, and create xx channel plots for the model, the scope and the difference with filtered frequencies, normalisation but no cropping.  Once you have this done, you are ready to start this tutorial.
